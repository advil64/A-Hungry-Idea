# Inspiration

We have volunteered at lots of homeless shelters and we know that one of their most common concern that they have is about food. We decided to create a site to solve that problem.

# What it does

It is a site that pairs up charities and organizations with restaurants that will make sure that food wastage is reduced and it goes to the right people.

# How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL

# Challenges we ran into

Time management and dealing with everyone's various levels of expertise.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We built a website that works and can do good for the world.

# What we learned

We learned that we need to plan better in advance and make sure that we can accomplish all the planned features.

# What's next for A Hungry Idea

Since we have built a prototype we want to refine it and start reaching out to local organizations and restaurants and get this set up in our local community and then expand.
